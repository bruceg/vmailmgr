2001-03-07  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* Renamed cli.h to cli++.h

2000-10-25  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* cli2pod.pl (parse_options): Ignore {0,} as well as {0}.

2000-08-15  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* cli2pod.pl: Replaced the CLI documentation programs with this
	script which outputs POD, which can be translated to man pages or
	HTML (or LaTeX, or text, or FM).

2000-08-14  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* cli_parse.pl (parse_header_line): Rewrote the parsing to deal
	with multi-line strings.

	* cli2man.pl (synopsis): Add usage string.

	* cli2html.pl (synopsis): Add usage string.

2000-08-12  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* cli_parse.pl, cli2html.pl, cli2man.pl: Created these programs.

2000-08-01  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* main.cc (show_option): Fixed several width glitches.

2000-07-18  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* cli.h (struct cli_option): Added new uinteger type.

	* main.cc (fill): Removed use of mystring.

2000-07-13  Bruce Guenter  <bruce@bruce-guenter.dyndns.org>

	* Removed include of mystring.

2000-01-09  Bruce Guenter  <bruceg@daedalus.bfsmedia.com>

	* main.cc (parse_short): Modified the logic here to treat a string
	value immediately following a string option as the value for that
	option rather than as more flags.  This makes it behave much more
	like the standard getopt library.

1999-09-30  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (show_option): Changed stringlist option string from
	"=LIST" to "=ITEM".

1999-09-29  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (cli_option::set): Fixed problem with setting a string
	list option.

1999-09-11  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (show_help): Split off two parts of this routine into
	calc_max_width and show_option.
	(show_option): Add "=INT" for integer options, and don't add extra
	space for non-value long options.
	(set): Use strtol instead of atoi to parse the integer string, to
	allow for error checking.
	(show_option): Fixed handling of string lists.

1999-08-14  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (set_argv0): Sets argv0 to the complete value of
	argv[0], argv0dir to the part of argv[0] up to and including the
	last '/' (or blank if there is none), and argv0base to the
	remainder of argv[0].  This is for use in programs that determine
	what to do based on the value of the program name.

1999-07-14  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (parse_long_eq): Fixed to account for "counter" flag
	type.
	(parse_long_noeq): Fixed to account for "counter" flag type.
	(parse_long_eq): set() will return one, but this shouldn't return
	one, so subtract one from its result.
	(show_help): Added a mechanism to display default values on a
	second line.
	(show_help): Output a blank line before the "--help" option line.

1999-07-04  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (show_help): Only show a "=VALUE" for string and integer
	option types.

1999-06-30  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* messages.cc (cli_error): Moved this routine into a separate
	module, and added a "cli_warning" routine.

1999-06-25  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc (set): Added handling for two new option types: string
	list and counters.  A stringlist maintains a linked list of all
	the given option arguments.  A counter adds the flag_value to the
	dataptr each time it is encountered.
	(parse_short): Fixed faulty logic regarding options with values.
	Need to merge parts into cli_option::set().

1999-06-24  Bruce Guenter  <bguenter@mikhail.qcc.sk.ca>

	* main.cc: Rewrote the "help" option handling to stop it being a
	special case, by making an internal option list that includes a
	"help" option at the end of it.
	(show_help): Cleaned up the option formatting to produce more
	correct output.
	(build_options): Removed the need to count the options.  Note
	that this breaks compatibility with previous versions.
	(cli_error): Added this convenience function for the CLI program
	to report errors and optionally exit.
	(set): Added functionality to call functions when an option is
	parsed, and moved some of the option parsing into class methods
	from the structure.
	(main): Moved the test for showing the usage information before
	the test for counting command-line arguments.
